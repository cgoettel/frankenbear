// blocking out ideas and code that needs to be written

// wiggle ears and play sound when button in hand (foot?) is pressed:
//     detect button click (debounce?)
//     signal for servos in ears to oscillate
//     oscillate for three(?) cycles

// hug when kissed or hugged
//     Detect change in relative temperature
//     have servos in arms bend in, hold for a couple seconds, release
//     need to check if arm has been manually bent already and don't hug if so (will this already be taken care of with the PWM signal sent?)
//     
//     

// accelerometer(?): when picked up (how to detect just being picked up? change in only y-axis?)
//     have bear say hello (or whatever)
//     wiggle ears?
